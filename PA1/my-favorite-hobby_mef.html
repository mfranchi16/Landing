			<p id="bigger">Many people like to run 5ks, half-marathons, and marathons. One of my favorite things to do is participate in mud runs or obstacle course races. In high school I participated in several 5ks and various road races. These races are only fun when you actually win or place within your age division. When you participate in a mud race you have fun whether you win or lose. Race distances can vary in mud races, but there are obstacles placed throughout the race, which make it go by fast and cause you to have more fun. Obstacles can vary, but an example obstacle would be a wall that you have to climb over. Mud races are their own beast when you compare them to road races.</p>

			<h2>Preparation</h2>
			<p id="bigger">These races require preparation or training if you want to feel good about you performance at the race. Some people do not prepare or train for these races, but these are the people who take several hours to complete the race. Below is a workout which I do to prepare for races such as these: </p>
			<h3>Example Workout</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>3 Mile Run</li>
				<li>25 Leg Lifts</li>
				<li>50 Crunches</li>
				<li>50 De Bugs</li>
				<li>50 Flat Leg Crunches</li>
				<li>1 Minute Plank</li>
			</ul>
